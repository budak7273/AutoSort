Update 8 support. New switch to toggle auto-sorting on or off from your inventory. Now a client-side only mod. This update brought to you by Robb.

## New Stuff

Boyshall no longer has access to the mod's original source code,
so this version of the mod is a rewrite.

- You can now enable/disable auto sorting if you want it off temporarily
  - You can do this from the mod configs or from the switch mentioned below:
- A switch is present next to the Sort button in your inventory to toggle auto-sorting on or off
  - If you don't want this switch, you can disable it from the mod configs
- SML3.7/server support. You can run this mod client side only as long as the server has SML installed.
- The mod will automatically sort your inventory even when opening containers like Storage Crates. I (Robb) haven't used the mod before, so I'm not sure if this was already a feature or not, but it is now.
