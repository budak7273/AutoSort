# Auto Sort

Automatically sort your player inventory when you open it (or a container that normally displays your inventory's sort button).

You can temporarily pause sorting via the switch near the sorting button or the mod configuration files.

Client-side only in multiplayer - you can use this mod on any server as long as the server has SML installed.
